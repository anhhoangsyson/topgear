# Technical Debt Tracker - Top Gear Project

## 🚨 Current Technical Debt (Quality Score: 0/100) - **28 Issues** ⬇️

### ✅ COMPLETED ITEMS

#### Console.log Statements ~~(3 files)~~ ✅ DONE
- ~~**Files**: ListOrderDetails.tsx, FormStep1.tsx, route.ts~~
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (June 5, 2025)
- **Result**: All console.log statements removed successfully
- **Time Spent**: 30 minutes (faster than estimated!)

### HIGH PRIORITY 🔴

#### 'any' Types (13 files)
- **Files**: Multiple components and utilities
- **Impact**: Loss of type safety, potential runtime errors

### MEDIUM PRIORITY 🟡

#### Large Files (15 files, >300 lines)
- **Largest**: multiple-selector.tsx (608 lines), FormStep1.tsx (520 lines)
- **Impact**: Hard to maintain, test, and review
- **Effort**: 20 hours
- **Plan**: Break down into smaller components

### Debt Tracking

## 🔄 Debt Tracking Process

### 1. Identifying Technical Debt
When you encounter technical debt, add it here with:
- **Description**: What is the problem?
- **Impact**: How does it affect the project? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Effort**: How much work to fix? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Root Cause**: Why did this happen?
- **Location**: Which files/components are affected?

### 2. Prioritization Matrix
```
High Impact + Low Effort = Quick Wins (Do First)
High Impact + High Effort = Major Projects (Plan Carefully)
Low Impact + Low Effort = Fill-in Tasks (Do When Available)
Low Impact + High Effort = Questionable (Avoid)
```

### 3. Resolution Template
```markdown
## Fixed: [Debt Item Name]
**Date**: [Date Fixed]
**Time Spent**: [Hours]
**Files Changed**: [List of files]

### Before:
- Description of the problem

### After:
- Description of the solution

### Lessons Learned:
- What caused this debt?
- How to prevent similar issues?

### Impact:
- Performance improvement
- Code readability
- Maintainability
```
